# Real Estate Price Prediction in Rio de Janeiro

## Description

This project develops a price prediction tool for short-term rental properties in Rio de Janeiro. The goal is to help common landlords estimate a fair daily rental price for their properties and assist tenants in identifying attractive prices based on similar properties.

## Data

The data used was extracted from Kaggle: [Airbnb Rio de Janeiro](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allanbruno/airbnb-rio-de-janeiro). The dataset contains information on property prices and their characteristics, collected monthly from April 2018 to May 2020 (except for June 2018). The values are expressed in Brazilian reais (R$).

The .csv data files are stored in the Dataset folder.

## Accessing the Data
